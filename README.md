# Rendering Algorithms showcased using blender

You'll find here my repo for the animations I built for my [ efficient rendering algorithms and clustered shading article. ](http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/02/CG.html) which you can find in that link.


I used the Blender 2.8 beta to build most of the diagrams and gimp to modify any images. I also had to resize some of them to fit in my webpage so I used imagemagick for that.
