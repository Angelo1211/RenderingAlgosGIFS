# Rendering Algorithms animations

This is my repo for the animations of the [ efficient rendering algorithms and clustered shading article. ](http://www.aortiz.me/2018/12/02/CG.html).

I used Blender 2.8 beta to build most of the iages and gimp to modify them and export them as gifs. I also had to resize some of them to fit my webpage so I used imagemagick for that.
